Blue Learn Hackathon - Team Snollygoster

The biggest edtech platform in the world and especially for rual areas is YouTube.
Unfortunately YouTube is not built for education and edtech platforms such as Unacademy and Byjus may not be financially feasible for some.

Flask, SQLAlchemy, Google Calendar API, Youtube API

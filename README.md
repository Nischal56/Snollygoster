## Project Description

The biggest edtech platform in the world and especially for rual areas is YouTube.
Unfortunately YouTube is not built for education and edtech platforms such as Unacademy and Byjus may not be financially feasible for some.
Our project optimises YouTube for education and gives a personalised roadmap for the student while removing any distraction that YouTube entices students with.

1. Flask
2. SQLAlchemy
3. Google Calendar API
4. Youtube API
